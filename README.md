# Chinese-Handwritten-Digit-Classification

This project aims to classify handwritten Chinese numeral characters using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow/Keras. The project utilizes the Chinese MNIST dataset, a collection of images containing handwritten Chinese numbers.

# Dependencies

Python 3.x

NumPy

pandas

seaborn

matplotlib

TensorFlow (2.x recommended)

Keras

# Installation and Execution

1. Install dependencies: 

pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib tensorflow keras

2. Download the Chinese MNIST dataset:  Obtain the dataset from the appropriate source (e.g., online repository).
   

3. Install a Chinese font: Find and install a compatible Chinese font (e.g., SimHei.ttf) for visualization purposes.

4. Run the code:
python chinese_mnist_classification.py


# Notes

Experiment with different CNN architectures, hyperparameters, and data augmentation techniques to potentially improve performance.
Consider evaluating the model using additional metrics beyond accuracy.
